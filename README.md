# Process Simulator (CLI) â€” FCFS / SJF / Round-Robin

A Python command-line app that simulates classic CPU scheduling algorithms and prints neat ASCII Gantt charts, per-process metrics, and summary stats.

#  Features

Algorithms: FCFS, non-preemptive SJF, and Round-Robin (preemptive).

Inputs: Inline via CLI, JSON file, or CSV.

Outputs:

ASCII Gantt chart

Per-process Waiting, Turnaround, Response times

CPU Utilization, Throughput, Context Switches, Avg metrics

Edge cases handled: idle CPU gaps, ties, zero arrival times, variable quanta, non-zero arrivals.

Deterministic tie-breaking (PID) for reproducible results.

Library mode (import functions in your own scripts).

Color output toggle (optional).


# Algorithms

FCFS (First-Come, First-Served): Non-preemptive, ordered by arrival, FIFO.

SJF (Shortest Job First): Non-preemptive, picks shortest remaining job among arrived; ties by arrival then PID.

Round-Robin (RR): Preemptive, fixed time quantum, fair time slicing among ready processes

# Roadmap

 - Preemptive SJF (SRTF)

 - Priority (pre/non-preemptive)

 - I/O bursts & Gantt for I/O

 - HTML/PNG chart export

 - Interactive TUI mode

 - Probabilistic workload generator

# Acknowledgements

Built for students learning OS scheduling and for anyone who likes pretty ASCII timelines. Inspired by classic OS textbooks and lab exercises.
